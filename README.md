[![Download ZIP](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20ZIP-8A2BE2)](https://github.com/fastah/ip-geofeed-skills/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

This package has self-help resources from Siddharth "Sid" Mathur's talk at [NANOG 96](https://nanog.org/events/nanog-96/) San Francisco - [High-quality IP Geofeeds using AI Coding Assistants and MCP](https://nanog.org/events/nanog-96/content/5683/).

AI coding agents should be asked to read IP geolocation feed validation guidance in [SKILL.md](skills/validator/SKILL.md).

## Pre-requisites

- IDE - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
- For [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat), enable the experimental [`chat.useAgentSkills`](vscode://settings/chat.useAgentSkills) feature, see [Agent Skills help](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills). Related [VS Code config file](.vscode/settings.json).

- For [Claude Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code) - enable [Skills in Settings -> Capabilities](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/12512180-using-skills-in-claude). Then make a `validator.zip` ZIP file from the [`skills/validator`](skills/validator) folder, and upload it as an Agent Skill. Enterprise users must also enable `Code execution and file creation`.

- For [ChatGPT Codex](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openai.chatgpt), enable [Skills](https://developers.openai.com/codex/skills/) with the `[[skills.config]]` flag.

- *Windows only*: Use the Microsoft Store for self-updating [VS Code](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/xp9khm4bk9fz7q?hl=en-US&gl=US), [Python](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pnrbtzxmb4z?hl=en-US&gl=US), and [PowerShell](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9mz1snwt0n5d?hl=en-US&gl=US).

## Quick guide

### Amp

Install the skill directly from GitHub:

```shell
amp install github.com/fastah/ip-geofeed-skills/validator
```

Then invoke it with:

```
/skill validator
```

Or simply ask Amp to validate a geofeed and it will auto-select the skill.

### VS Code / GitHub Copilot

Clone this repository into your workspace, and the skill will be discovered automatically from the `skills/` directory.

## What are (AI) Agent Skills

AI [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/home) is an open standard that works across multiple AI tools to make domain-specific knowledge easier to share - which in this repository's case is IP Geolocation feed validation. 

Partial list of AI tools that support Agent Skills:

- [GitHub Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills) - VS Code, Copilot CLI, coding agent
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/docs/context/skills)
- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)
- [Amp Code](https://ampcode.com/news/agent-skills) - VS Code and Amp CLI

## Troubleshooting

1. VS Code - turn ON the experimental Agent Skills flag ([config](.vscode/settings.json)).
